### Professional Information

Hi, I'm Josi. I'm a college Comp Sci student currently pursuing my B.S. I have experience in [Java with Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)), [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)), [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)), and [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)). I currently work as a Technical Intern at i3 Verticals. I love learning and have been fascinated with coding and computer science for over a decade.



I can be reached [here](/_pages/contact) for business inquiries and feedback or on Instagram.
